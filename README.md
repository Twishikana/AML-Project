# AML Project 

This project was a submission for my Advanced ML coursework in Spring 2020.

We worked on implementing the Synaptic Intelligence Algorithm for Continual Learning [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04200) for our project. 
We studied the algorithm and themn compared it to the other standard Continual Learning methods like EWC and GEM. The code for GEM was sourced from the actual implementation of GEM and refactored to use for our dataset.
The PPT, in short, summarizes the entire paper.
