# AML Project 

This project was a submission for my Advanced ML coursework in Spring 2020.

We worked on implementing the Synaptic Intelligence Algorithm for Continual Learning [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04200) for our project. 
We studied the algorithm and themn compared it to the other standard Continual Learning methods like [EWC](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00796) and [GEM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.08840). The code for GEM was sourced from the actual implementation of GEM and refactored to use for our dataset.
The PPT, in short, summarizes the entire paper.
